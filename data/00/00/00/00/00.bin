  |   It is a metaphorical game filled with illusions and hidden            |
  |   messages.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In the world of OVIVO, Black and White exist in harmony. By           |
  |   constantly intertwining and replacing each other, they maintain       |
  |   balance. The main character named OVO was born of these two halves    |
  |   and has the ability to switch between them. OVO travels through the   |
  |   metaphorical world, overcoming dangers and collecting mysterious      |
  |   symbols. These symbols will help you unravel the story of this        |
  |   world, but how you interpret it is completely up to you.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Flow mechanics. In white, gravity points downward, in black -       |
  |     upward. Because momentum is preserved when transitioning from one   |
  |     color to another, OVO can float along their border as if being      |
  |     carried by a flow                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Fascinating art. The allegorical world of OVIVO is full of hidden   |
  |     images and optical illusions                                        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Design without words. There is almost no text in the game and the   |
  |     story is told through gameplay and visuals                          |
  |                                                                         |
